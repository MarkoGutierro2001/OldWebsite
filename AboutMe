            <p> First, I wake up. I've never understood why people write this. Don't we all?
            Well, to specify, I wake up at <i>6:08 A.M.</i> I then take a shower. However, contrary to normal standards,
            I always end my showers cold. This is because it has multiple heath benefits. For example, one
            reason ending showers cold is beneficial is because it can cure acne. The cold
            water tightens pores which prevents them from clogging. Anyway, afterwards, I eat breakfast. 
            Normally this will be a piece of bread with peanut butter because it is quick and easy to make.
            Last, after having eaten my food I brush my teeth. Once all of the above is completed, 
            I then drive to school. I leave at <i>7:10 </i>and make it for classes at <i>7:35</i>

                <tr>
                    <th class = "cred"> A </th>
                    <th class = "cred"> B </th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td> AP Computer Science &nbsp; </td>
                    <td> US History II H &nbsp; </td>

                    <td> Physics H</td>
                    <td> Study Hall</td>

                    <td> Algebra II H</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p> Instead of writing about each class I go to, I will instead 
                write which class is my favorite on A and B day. This would have
                to be Computer Science on A day and Digital Media on B day.
                Although different classes, I love these classes for the 
                same reason. They both offer a creative outlet. I am not the best
                artist but these two classes allow me to create without 
                utensils. In AP CS I would love to learn how to become proficient at
                building websites. It's incredible to look at websites once they've 
                been finished and appreciate the effort behind them. 
                In Digital Media I would love to learn
                how to become a better videographer. It's fulfilling whenever
                I am able to capture a stirring image.
                My school day ends at <i>2:05</i> and I arrive home 
                at about <i>2:15.</i>

            <p> Once I arrive home it is homework time. Honestly, it is more
                of a compulsive issue than my own freely willed desire. For some reason, 
                I cannot feel at ease if I do not finish my homework as soon as possible.
                Considering a large potion of my friends are procastinators, I see it as 
                a blessing and a curse. After homework, I will watch 
                    <a href = https://www.youtube.com/> youtube</a> or play 
                video games to wind down after the day.

            <p>I end up going to bed between <i>9:30 P.M.</i> and <i>10:30 P.M.
                </i> I believe sleep is one of the most important parts of 
                the day for your body. Modern science still does not know 
                how exactly it does it, but sleep always manages to refuel your body 
                for the next day.
